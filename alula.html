            <h2>About AlUla</h2>
            <p>AlUla is a living museum of preserved tombs, sandstone outcrops, historic dwellings, and monuments, both natural and human-made, that hold 200,000 years of largely unexplored human history. Located in northwestern Saudi Arabia, AlUla covers 22,561 square kilometers and features dramatic desert landscapes, ancient rock formations, and archaeological treasures that showcase the crossroads of civilizations.</p>

            <p>The region served as a vital link on the ancient incense trade routes connecting the Arabian Peninsula with the Mediterranean, Egypt, and beyond. Today, AlUla stands as a testament to the ingenuity and artistry of past civilizations, from the Nabataeans to the Lihyanites, and represents Saudi Arabia's commitment to preserving and sharing its rich cultural heritage.</p>

            <h3>Historical Significance</h3>
            <p>AlUla's history spans millennia, with evidence of human settlement dating back to prehistoric times. The region flourished as a crucial trading hub where caravans carrying frankincense, myrrh, and spices would stop and rest. Multiple civilizations left their mark here, creating a unique archaeological landscape that tells the story of human achievement and cultural exchange.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Lihyan made AlUla its capital around the 5th century BCE, followed by the Nabataeans who established their southern capital here. Later, the region became part of the Roman Empire, and in the 7th century CE, it served as a stop on the pilgrimage route to Makkah.</p>

            <h3>Hegra - The Crown Jewel</h3>
            <p>Hegra, also known as Madain Salih, is AlUla's most famous attraction and Saudi Arabia's first UNESCO World Heritage Site (designated in 2008). This ancient Nabataean city features 111 monumental tombs, most with elaborate facades carved directly into sandstone outcrops.</p>

            <p>The Nabataeans, famous for building Petra in Jordan, demonstrated remarkable engineering skills in Hegra. The tombs showcase intricate architectural details, religious symbols, and inscriptions that provide invaluable insights into Nabataean culture, beliefs, and daily life. Unlike Petra, Hegra is remarkably well-preserved, partly due to the dry desert climate and its relative isolation until recent times.</p>

            <h3>Notable Tombs at Hegra</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Qasr al-Farid (The Lonely Castle):</strong> The most photographed tomb, standing alone and unfinished, showcasing the carving process</li>
